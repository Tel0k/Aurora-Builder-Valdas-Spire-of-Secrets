# Aurora-Builder-Valdas-Spire-of-Secrets
You can extend Aurora by including content using index files. 
Go to the Additional Content tab in Aurora, enter the RAW URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tel0k/Aurora-Builder-Valdas-Spire-of-Secrets/main/elements/valdas-spire-of-secrets.index) of the index file, and have Aurora download the content to the custom folder for you. 
When these files get updated, Aurora will be able to keep content files up to date automatically. 
Should you want to, you can turn off automatic updates in the application settings and check for updates manually.
