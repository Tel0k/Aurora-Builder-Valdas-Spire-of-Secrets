			<p>One or more of your organs or limbs has been replaced with a part harvested from a monster. A replacement can effectively solve any amputation or organ failure, but they can't return to life someone that has died; such work is solely the domain of necromancy. Replacement limbs can resemble the original limb, or can demonstrate obvious monstrous characteristics, depending on the donor. A replacement organ or limb takes up one body slot relevant to it; for example, a troll's hand takes the Arms slot and a replacement kidney takes up the Internal slot.</p>
