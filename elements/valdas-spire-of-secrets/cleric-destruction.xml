			<p>Some gods revel only in the crushing of walls and the burning of cities. These gods of destruction, critical counterparts to the gods of creation and mercy, need not be evil, but have a strong tendency toward chaos and enforcing the eternal cycle of death and rebirth. Clerics who follow such deities often have a deep personal connection with their chosen god. In some cases, they were spared from destruction in order to wreak it upon others; in others, they have pleaded with the god for priesthood to destroy a single foe; others still simply worship their god out of reverent fear.</p>

            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can funnel the entropic energies of the universe into your spells as a bonus action. For the next minute, whenever you deal damage with a cleric spell, it is empowered with ruinous potential. If you roll the highest number possible on any of the spell's damage dice, you can roll that die again and add its damage to the total, rolling again if this number is also the highest, and so on. You can roll a total number of damage dice for this spell equal to twice the number of damage dice you initially rolled.</p>

            <p>By 6th level, your devastating magic leaves only ruins behind. Once on each of your turns, when you cast a 1st level or higher cleric spell that deals fire, force, lightning, radiant, or thunder damage, you can emit a shockwave that crumbles the environment around one creature that takes damage from the spell. The shockwave is a 5-foot radius sphere centered on the creature that only damages objects that aren't being worn or carried. Each object in the area takes damage equal to twice the damage dealt to the creature, ignoring the object's damage threshold.</p>
