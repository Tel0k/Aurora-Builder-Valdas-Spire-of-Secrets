		<description>
	<p>A collage of diagrams, maps, and small items litters the wall, pinned with nails and connected by a spiderweb of colorful strings. An elf stands nearby, contemplating the mystery splayed out in front of her and readying her crossbow for work. </p>
	<p class="indent">A half-orc wearing a wide-brimmed hat leafs through a thick tome, double-checking the supplies: a sturdy net trap, holy symbols on the doors, cloves of garlic, and several dozen wooden stakes. The preparations made, the half-orc slinks into the shadows and readies himself for the bloodshed. </p>
	<p class="indent">Blood dripping from its fangs and claws, a monstrously fat demon bears down on a human, who busies herself marking a tavern's door frame with a few chalkmark runes. She takes a long step back and waits. As the demon lunges for its next meal, an invisible force lashes forth from the doorway, lopping off its hand and raking its stomach. The fiend howls with rage, and the inquisitor breathes a sigh of relief.</p>
	<p class="indent">Supernatural detectives and monster slayers, investigators are always on the hunt for malevolent outsiders. Whenever evil seeps into the world—be it fiends, undead, or strange abominations from beyond the stars—investigators will be the first to locate them and banish their foul corruption from the mortal plane.</p>
	<h4>PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS</h4>
	<p>There are forces more ancient than time, foes more sinister than the foulest men, and beings more titanic than gods. The world stands on a precipice of woe and terror, being threatened nightly by dark agents and hordes of monsters. At risk to their own lives and sanities, investigators penetrate the evil that creeps in the shadows and banish it from the world. Their battles are never-ending, for victory only delays doomsday another night.</p>
	<p class="indent">Investigators track supernatural threats ranging from incorporeal spirits, to nefarious vampires and lycanthropes, to incursions of demons and devils. Often in their investigations, they uncover secret cults and maligned individuals who bring these supernatural threats to bear. It is always their goal to impede these evildoers by any means necessary, resorting to trickery, guile, magic, and bloodshed when necessary. To an investigator, no tactic is unthinkable when the world is at stake.</p>
	<h4>EXORCISTS AND OCCULTISTS</h4>
	<p>Even as they strive to contain its influence from the world at large, investigators dabble in forbidden magic to give themselves an edge against supernatural threats. Prepared investigators keep a well-stocked grimoire of magical secrets, containing rituals, incantations, notes on monsters' powers and weaknesses, recipes for poisons, and arcane diagrams—everything needed to confront their foes on an even footing. Even so, an investigator's occupation is perilous. A grimoire might spell out a vampire's fear of sunlight and aversion to silver, but it does little to hinder their fangs.</p>
	<h4>CREATING A INVESTIGATOR</h4>
	<p>As you build your investigator, consider what sort of supernatural threat first drove you to investigating and combating the occult. Did one of your family members strike a bargain with a fiend? Were you kidnapped by a cabal of vampires or a pack of lycanthropes? Did you stumble across evidence of an eldritch abomination, such as a Great Old One? The type of creature you first did battle with likely shaped your tools and methods later on.</p>
	<p class="indent">Did you apprentice under a seasoned monster hunter, learning the ropes of tracking a threat, uncovering its weaknesses, and setting a trap for it? Or did you strike out on your own, compiling your own grimoire from hard-earned research? Perhaps you learned everything about monster hunting from someone else's grimoire, a masterwork containing an abridged library of occult knowledge and a lifetime of experience. It's even possible that you signed a contract with a minor fiend and turned to supernatural investigation in a last-ditch effort to save your soul.</p>
	<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
	<p>Follow these suggestions to build an investigator quickly: Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Strength. Then, select the rituals <i>clue</i>, <i>comprehend languages</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, and <i>transient bulwark</i> to add to your grimoire. Finally, pick any background, preferably one that relates to your experience with supernatural monsters and the occult.</p>

			<p>You maintain a grimoire brimming with magical rituals: your most potent tools to defeat supernatural threats.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">GRIMOIRE</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you have a grimoire containing four 1st-level spells of your choice that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the spells needn't be from the same list). You can't cast spells that are in your grimoire except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can add an additional ritual spell from the Investigator Spells list (see Chapter 6) to your grimoire at no cost. The Ritual Level column on the Investigator table shows the maximum spell level you can add to your grimoire.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, whenever you find a ritual spell on your adventures, you can add it to your grimoire if it is on the investigator spell list and is of a level you can add to your grimoire. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">BONUS RITUALS</h5>
			<p>As an investigator, you can treat specific spells as if they had the ritual tag, allowing you to add them to your grimoire and cast them as rituals. These spells are marked in the investigator spell list.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your ritual spells, since you master your spells through deduction and cunning. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, when you cast an investigator ritual or a spell offered to you by a feature in this class, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC and making an attack roll.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

		<description>
			<p>By 7th level, you always keep a wide array of holy symbols and blessed items on your person, even if you aren't particularly pious. When you use your Opportunistic Piety, you choose which effect to create from the list below. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Opportunistic Piety again.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Banish.</strong> You cast the <i>banishment</i> spell without expending a spell slot. If the target is a Fey, Fiend, or Undead and fails its saving throw against this spell, it also takes radiant damage equal to your level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Miracle Healing.</strong> As an action, divine light from your hands knit the wounds of a willing creature you touch. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to twice your investigator level. This ability has no effect on Undead or Constructs.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Warding.</strong> As an action, you trace a holy symbol on a creature within 5 feet of you, warding it against harm. For the next minute, Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead that touch the warded creature or hit it with a melee attack take 1d12 radiant damage.</p>
