		<description>
			<p>The gods have seen a great cataclysm on the horizon and tasked their martyr with protecting the world from catastrophe. The exact nature of the coming End may vary: sometimes the awakening or arrival of an evil entity, sometimes the discovery and abuse of a powerful artifact, and sometimes a singularly destructive event that endangers the gods themselves, but the martyr must be dedicated to give their life to stop it. To this end, the gods imbue their martyr with ancient and powerful spells, tools once gifted only to prophets.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the coming cataclysm threatens the world, a martyr would be ill-served to ignore their call, for the cataclysm imperils them directlyâ€”as well as the lives of their family and companions. The life of a martyr is always forfeit, but the rest of the world can yet be saved.</p>
