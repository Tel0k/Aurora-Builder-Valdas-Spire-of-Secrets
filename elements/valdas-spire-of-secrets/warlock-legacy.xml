		<description>
			<p>Rather than forging a pact inked by blood or bound to your soul, you have inherited a Legacy, a patron embodied by a line of inheritors sworn to a sacred cause. In so doing, you have acquired a relic of this ancient legacy, an object of unimaginable power passed down through the generations or recently uncovered from a long-lost civilization. With it, you can transform into the most powerful version of yourself to continue your Legacy's fight.</p>
			<p class="indent">Countless Legacies have imbued warlocks with ancient powers, and only a few remain today, but each possesses a unique type of relic and bestows a unique type of transformation. How you use this transformation is ultimately up to you, but the Legacy conspires to see you achieve greatness and advance its unknowable ancient goals.</p>

			<p>Beginning when you choose this subclass at 1st level, you have a magical relic tied to your patron which allows you to undergo a fantastic transformation or reverse it as a bonus action. The exact nature of the transformation varies from Legacy to Legacy, but it always changes your appearance and confers dramatic power. While transformed, you have the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.</li>
				<li>Unless a creature has truesight or watches you transform, you can't be recognized as your true identity.</li>
				<li>You have a pool of battle dice, which are d6s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative. Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Battle Dice table on the next page.</li>
				<li>Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can roll a battle die and add it to the attack's damage roll.</li>
