        <description>
            <p class="flavor">Ever a joy to children, geppettin resemble living playthings made of wood, cloth, or porcelain. Though easily mistaken for puppets, geppettin are not manipulated by a just-out-of-sight puppeteer; they are animated, sentient, and independent.</p>
			<h4>LIVING TOYS</h4>
			<p>As a race, the geppettin are an oddity. Though rare, they are numerous enough and share enough similarities with each other that they may be counted as an actual race of people, and not just freak mishaps of magic. While it may be that there are dedicated creators of geppettin, as there are with golems, a significant number of them have come to life on their own.</p>
			<p class="indent">Physically, geppettin are often shorter than halflings. Their physical features vary greatly from type to type, but they are almost always humanoid in shape. For simplicity, geppettin are classified by the materials of which they are composed: bisque are porcelain, marionettes are wood, and plushies are made of fabric.</p>
			<p class="indent">Despite being made of somewhat flimsy materials, sentience seems to grant them an odd hardiness. Additionally, due to their non-living nature, they never hunger, rarely tire, and are adept at being innocuous. Most find some form of work or profession in entertainment, but a few find fantastic success as spies and assassins.</p>
            <p class="indent">As living constructs, geppettin do not age, and are mature as soon as they become sentient.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Bisque geppettin are a form of porcelain doll, crafted with exacting specification and often luxurious clothing materials. Though they are designed to look as realistic as possible, they are often thought to be the most terrifying of geppettin due to their lifeless visage. Though their faces are often very fragile, their construction is generally much hardier than their brethren’s.</p>
