			<p>While all warlocks are skilled in the art of magic, very few are what most people would consider “magicians,” skilled in the arts of physical illusion, sleight of hand, and showmanship. Those with such talents might find themselves drawn to the mysterious Magician, believed to be a minor trickster deity (who most often takes the form of a white rabbit), long forgotten and bereft of worshipers. Under the Magician's patronage, warlocks command an amalgamation of real and fake magic, such that it's never clear if they're casting spells, performing a ruse, or putting on a show.</p>

			<p><em>10th-level Magician feature</em></p>
			<p>When you reach 10th level, you learn to alter your spellcasting in a number of ways, both to hide it from your audience and to expand your magical repertoire. Whenever you cast a warlock spell of 1st level or higher using a warlock spell slot, you can manipulate it in one of two ways:</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Conceal.</b> You can cast the spell without using spell components by succeeding on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DC for this check equals 8 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell fails and its spell slot is wasted. You can't use this ability on a spell with material components that have a cost.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Transmute.</b> You can attempt to cast any other spell from the wizard spell list of the same level or lower instead of the spell you initially cast. When you do so, you must succeed on a Charisma check with a DC equal to 12 + the spell's level. Otherwise, the spell fails and its spell slot is wasted.</p>
