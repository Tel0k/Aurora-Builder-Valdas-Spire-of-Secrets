		<description>
			<p>Barbarians who follow the Path of Tranquility embrace a zen philosophy of restraint and moderation, much in contrast with their furious brethren. Embraced by the fey and called “the serene,” these barbarians are calm, tactical warriors who issue swift retaliation instead of violent assaults. At their pinnacle, the serene are one with nature and with themselves, entering flow states at will to dispatch their foes with dispassionate precision.</p>
