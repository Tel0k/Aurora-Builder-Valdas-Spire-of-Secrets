            <p>At 3rd level, you learn a hex that closes wounds and eases pain. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. This creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your witch level. A creature that regains hit points from this hex can't be affected by it again until it finishes a short or long rest.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 6th level, you can craft a magical talisman that wards off harm. Creating a talisman takes 1 hour of work, which can be performed over the course of a short rest. You can only have one of these talismans at a time; crafting a new talisman causes the previous one to become mundane. Any creature wearing the talisman can add a d4 to all saving throws it makes.</p>
