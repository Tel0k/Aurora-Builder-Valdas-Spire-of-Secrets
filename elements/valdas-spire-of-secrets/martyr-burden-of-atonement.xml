			<p>For all the wrong you have done in your life, the gods have graced you with an undeserved second chance. Your burden is to atone, to undo all the evils you have done in your life, and to seek redemption before the gods. How you accomplish this is your choice, so long as you remove any dark marks you leave behind. Ultimately, your final martyrdom might be a grand act, averting a great disaster or banishing a force of evil, or it might be as humble as redirecting the life of an evil person and causing them to seek redemption, passing the torch to a new martyr of atonement.</p>
