			<p class="indent"><b>Great Weapon Fighting.</b> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Hand-and-a-Half.</b> While wielding a versatile weapon in two hands, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon.</p>

			<p>Beginning at 7th level, you can use your knowledge of armament construction to disarm your foes and crush their armor. Once on each of your turns, when you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with one of the following special melee attacks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Disarm.</b> You attempt to disarm a target within your reach. The target makes a Strength saving throw against your Masterwork save DC. On a failed save, it drops one item of your choice that it is holding or carrying. The object lands at its feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Sunder.</b> You attempt to shatter the defenses of a target within your reach that is wearing armor or carrying a shield. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC. On a failed save, the target's armor or shield takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If a creature's armor or shield is damaged but not destroyed, it can repair it over the course of a short or long rest.</p>

			<p>By 14th level, you can wield all manner of weapons in rapid succession. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a weapon, you can gain advantage on the attack roll. You can use this ability four times: once to make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon that has the Ammunition property, once to make a melee weapon attack with a two-handed weapon, once to make a melee weapon attack with a one-handed weapon, and once to make a ranged weapon attack with a thrown weapon. Each use must be with a different weapon, and you regain each use of this ability after one minute. You can't use this ability if you have disadvantage on the attack roll, or if you can't see the target.</p>
