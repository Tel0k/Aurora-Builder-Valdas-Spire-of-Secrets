			<p>While most seasoned spellcasters will enchant a handful of magic items over the course of their careers, artisans belonging to the Guild of Arcane Maesters seek to become true masters of magic item creation. They rightly take seriously the forging of such powerful relics: each creation must be a masterwork in its own right to contain the potent magic woven into them. Despite laboring for months or even years to perfect their creations, seasoned maesters are always seen to be laden with dozens of magic items, attuned to a handful of rings, and carrying a wand of magic missiles, just in case.</p>
