			<p>Where rum flows easily, the gods of merriment abound. Clerics of the Rum Domain feel the fuzzy warmth of strong drink not as sinful excess, but as praise to the gods of good times, which they worship often and with abandon. They look to spread their merry religion and the good times with it, bringing all to RUM and happiness, a few nights of drunken revelry at a time.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, you can use your action to fill your mug with beer or rum, a gift of good tidings from the gods.
