        <description>
            <p>The defenders of the forests and champions of the trees, druids who join the Circle of the Fist take their charge as natural protectors seriously. Traditionally, all druid circles strive to protect the natural realm and maintain the world's balance, but only druids of this circle guard the woodlands with the vigilance and fervor of a territorial beast. Fists of the Forest, as they are called, stave off intruders to their realms with flurries of bare-fisted strikes, empowered by the natural world, before disappearing into the treetops. At the height of their expertise, these druids fight more like beasts of the forests than men, and are twice as deadly.</p>
            <p class="indent">Often, this druidic order safeguards sacred groves and permanent fey bridges, but sometimes its members adopt quests of vengeance for misdeeds done to the forest, or quests of intervention to ensure that a prophesied disaster doesn't come to pass.</p>

            <p>At 2nd level, you fight with the might of a feral beast. While you are unarmed and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier</li>
                <li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.</li>
                <li>You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. This die changes as you gain druid levels, as shown in the Untamed Strike table below. If the weapon die of your Beast form is less than your Untamed Strike die, you can use this die instead while in your Beast form.</li>
                <li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. If you also expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can make 2 unarmed strikes as a bonus action. If you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you make 3 unarmed strikes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
