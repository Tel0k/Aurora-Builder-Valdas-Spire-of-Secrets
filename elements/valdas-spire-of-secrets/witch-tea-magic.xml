			<p>Tea witches are among the calmest and friendliest of witches, radiating warmth and contentment despite their hideous faces and hollow souls. At their very worst, they can be cranky (if forced to drink their tea in a hurry), or twitchy (after too much tea), but even then, they are likely to look for peaceful solutions to their problems.</p>

            <p>Starting when you choose this craft at 3rd level, you can see glimpses of the future in your tea leaves. As an action, choose a friendly creature you can see within 60 feet of you, roll a d20, and record the number rolled. Until the end of your next turn, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by the creature with this foretelling roll. You must choose to do so before the roll. Once you replace a roll in this way, this hex ends.</p>

            <p>By 6th level, you can see deeper glimpses into the future through your tea leaves. When you finish a long rest, you can examine the shape of your tea leaves. The GM tells you a shape that hints at future events. For example, if you see a tower in your tea leaves, you might encounter a wizard on the following day. If you see a serpent, you might encounter a lair or a monster.</p>
