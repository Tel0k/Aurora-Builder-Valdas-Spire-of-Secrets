		<description>
			<p>Paladins who swear the Oath of Revelry make a solemn vow to party day and night until their hearts give out. The antithesis of stuffy, lawful crusaders, these emissaries of carousal travel the land, crashing parties and raising hell wherever they raise a glass. Authorities bristle at their arrival, but the youth cheer, for a Party Paladin is always accompanied by a good time.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF REVELRY</h5>
			<p>Many paladins who swear the Oath of Revelry choose to abide by the Codicus Brodicus, a doctrine of moral judgments, both foul and fair, about the way one should conduct life and party. In general, paladins who take this oath abide by the following principles: </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>The Party Don't Stop.</i></b> Every occasion deserves celebration, and everyone should be invited.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Work Hard, Party Hard.</i></b> Without planning and effort, a good bacchanal has no momentousness. Bring your “A” game to events.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Fight for Your Right to Party.</i></b> Those who would stand in your way need to be reminded what it's like to have a good time, or failing that, be circumvented.</p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Conjure Drink.</i></b> When you finish a long rest, you can use your Channel Divinity to summon to your flask a frothy ale from the heavens itself. Up to three creatures can drink from this flask, and each has advantage on the next saving throw it makes before it takes a long rest, after which the buzz wears off. When you take a short rest, any remaining ale becomes nonmagical.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Song and Dance.</i></b> You can use your Channel Divinity as an action to dance a catchy jig. Each creature you choose within 15 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw or join in. Creatures continue to dance as long as you do.</p>
			<p class="indent">Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. This effect ends for a creature if you choose to end it on your turn (no action required), or if the creature reattempts the Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn and succeeds.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature that is dancing spends all its movement tapping its feet and shuffling about without leaving its space. It also has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls that rely on Dexterity.</p>
