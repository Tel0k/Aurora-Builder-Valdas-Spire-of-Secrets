            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you know how to strip away your foes’ magical defenses. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw, and choose any one damage type. On a failed save, the creature loses resistance to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn, or is treated as only having resistance, if it has immunity to that damage type.</p>
