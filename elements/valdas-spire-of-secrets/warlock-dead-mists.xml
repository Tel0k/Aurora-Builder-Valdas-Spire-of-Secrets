			<p>The starry expanse of the Astral Plane contains horrors both great and small, but none rival the mass of astral fog known as the Dead Mists. An inky smoke that curls and drifts about the plane, they are infamous for claiming every incautious traveler that wanders into their misty embrace. Yet the Dead Mists aren't a mere astral hazard: they possess a grim intelligence, an intent, and a bottomless well of necromantic power.</p>
			<p class="indent">Warlocks that embrace the Dead Mists unlock a terrible type of necromancy: the ability to trade pure life essence for arcana. As such, the Dead Mists slowly consume their warlocks, granting them surges of arcane power in exchange for every drop of life they possess.</p>

			<p><em>1st-level Dead Mists feature</em></p>
			<p>Starting at 1st level, you learn to draw the withering Dead Mists into your soul, granting you eldritch insights and power at the cost of your health. As a bonus action, you can choose to lose hit points equal to 1d8 for each level of your Pact Magic spell slots. At the start of your next turn, you regain an expended Pact Magic spell slot. If this ability reduces you to 0 hit points, you are knocked unconscious, even if you have temporary hit points.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because of the soul-draining nature of the Dead Mists, you can't regain hit points from any spell you cast.</p>
