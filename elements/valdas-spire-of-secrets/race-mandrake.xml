		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Laymen believe that mandrakes are screaming, crying babies grown from the roots of a plant. However, small, wailing mandrakes are those which are harvested too early, literally children still in infancy. If allowed to grow for a year and a day before being harvested, they emerge fully-formed, able to mature into great and powerful tree people.</p>
			<h4>FLESH FROM WOOD</h4>
			<p>With a skin of thick bark and leaves growing at their extremities, you could be forgiven for believing that mandrakes are simply bizarre plants, treants, or animated trees. This might even be partially true: it seems that mandrakes originated from some plant ancestor, but through strange magic or stranger evolution, they have become something midway between animal and plant.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mandrake anatomies are filled with paradoxes: they bleed a ruby ichor, reminiscent of both blood and sap. Their hearts, which look like a knot of roots, pump this around their body, enriching it with oxygen borne by leaves and special pores on their extremities. By preference, mandrakes can bask in the sunlight or consume living things for nourishment, and can even absorb nutrients through their feet, though they rarely subsist by sunlight and water alone.</p>
			<h4>FOREST ENVOYS</h4>
			<p>Alchemists and arcanists alike scratch their heads at mandrakes, but druids know them as the green emissaries who stand between the realms of animals and plants, making peace for all parties. To druidic tradition, mandrakes are unique, ancient constructions of Mother Nature herself, intended to act as delegates for her will. Mandrakes are credited by old druids with aligning elves with the forests and dwarves with the mountains; only with the rising tide of humanoids and their preponderance of gods did most creatures forget about Mother Nature and her half-plant ambassadors.</p>
			<p class="indent">Today, mandrakes are rare, and make their homes in the forests near where villages and cities meet the true wilds. Humans tell tales of mandrakes savaging those who enter their domain, but druids and those who respect the old traditions of the forest know that such ire is seldom undeserved.</p>
			<h4>MANDRAKE NAMES</h4>
			<p>Taking their names from the old spirits of the forest, which have long been forgotten by men, mandrakes treat all names with great reverence.</p>
			<p>
	  	  <span class="feature">Male Names:</span>Akathaso, Bistonis, Cithaeron, Hathor, Nomina, Orseis, Othrys, Yggdras<br/>
			  <span class="feature">Female Names:</span>Argyra, Circe, Claea, Hadryade, Helike, Lauma, Moria, Thronia
			</p>
			<h4>MANDRAKE TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Because you are neither beast nor plant, you have the following characteristics: </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Mandrakes must grow undisturbed for a year and a day before they are harvested. They then mature in a decade and live for centuries, growing wider, with more gnarled bark as they age.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Mandrakes are known to keep centuries-old concords known only to the oldest of creatures. Though they stay neutral in most matters, they tend to lean toward lawful alignments.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Mandrakes usually stand tall and slim, usually almost seven feet high, with spring mandrakes being smaller and winter mandrakes being slightly larger, and often hunched over. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Plant Nature.</em></strong> Even though you are not fully a plant, you still possess many of the same traits as one. As long as you are within direct sunlight for at least 4 hours a day, you do not need to eat. Additionally, you can breathe through your leaves and extremities and can absorb water and nutrients through your feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">Even if you are not proficient in Stealth, you can add your proficiency bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks that you make to hide in natural environments, such as forests.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Root Magic.</em></strong> You know the <em>shillelagh</em> cantrip and can target yourself with the spell, treating one of your limbs as a club instead of an unarmed strike. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <em>goodberry</em> spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the <em>barkskin</em> spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common. You can also communicate simple ideas to nonmagical plants and can question plants about events that occurred nearby during the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Seasonal Subrace.</em></strong> Depending on the season in which mandrakes are harvested, they take on vastly different characteristics when they mature. Pick one seasonal subrace from Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.</p>
