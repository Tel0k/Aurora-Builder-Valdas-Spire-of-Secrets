		<description>
			<p>Paladins who swear the Oath of Eternal Night forgo the lofty standards of conduct and shining armor of their compatriots: instead, they don blackened armor and carry out assassinations, conduct subterfuge, and mete out vigilante justice under cover of night. Such paladins, often called ravens, bind themselves to higher ideals of justice, transcending law and allegiances, so that they can right the wrongs that go unpunished. Every foul action has its consequence, and when no others rise to the challenge, the blade of a raven is not far behind.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF ETERNAL NIGHT</h5>
			<p>Paladins who swear the Oath of Eternal Night share a sense of moral absolutism and tend to believe in the following core tenets:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>None are Exempt.</i></b> Even kings and magistrates that write the laws must be held accountable to them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Good of the Many.</i></b> The needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few. It is your charge to protect the weak when the powerful seek to oppress.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Knight of Night.</i></b> When justice is not done in the light of day, it must be restored in darkness.</p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Cover of Darkness.</i></b> As a bonus action using your Channel Divinity, you can create a 15-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness centered on a point you can see within 30 feet of you. This sphere spreads around corners and lasts for one minute. You can see through darkness you create in this way.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Shrouded Armor.</i></b> As an action using your Channel Divinity, you can draw shadowstuff from the Plane of Shadow and imbue it upon a suit of armor you are wearing. This armor is cloaked in a tenebrous swirl and reflects no light. You can add your Charisma modifier to Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make while wearing the armor, and the armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Stealth checks.</p>
			<p class="indent">This effect ends after 8 hours, or if you end the effect on your turn (no action required). The effect ends early if you remove your armor or fall unconscious.</p>
