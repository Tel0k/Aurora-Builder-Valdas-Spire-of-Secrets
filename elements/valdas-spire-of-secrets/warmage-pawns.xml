            <p>By far the most prominent warmage House is that of the Pawns. Warmages which join the House of Pawns learn to stretch their skill with cantrips to its limits. Pawns can master any cantrip or trick known to the other warmage houses, for they embody the adaptability all warmages aspire to.</p>

            <p>When you choose this house at 3rd level, you gain the adaptability of the quintessential warmage. You learn one warmage trick of your choice, which doesn’t count against your total number of warmage tricks known. Additionally, whenever you learn a warmage trick, you can learn tricks which have the House of Bishops, House of Kings, House of Knights, or House of Rooks as a prerequisite, so long as you meet all of the tricks other prerequisites.</p>
