		<description>
			<p>Paladins who swear the Oath of the Sun make a solemn vow to party day and night until their hearts give out. The antithesis of stuffy, lawful crusaders, these emissaries of carousal travel the land, crashing parties and raising hell wherever they raise a glass. Authorities bristle at their arrival, but the youth cheer, for a Party Paladin is always accompanied by a good time.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF THE SUN</h5>
			<p>Many paladins who swear the Oath of the Sun choose to abide by the Codicus Brodicus, a doctrine of moral judgments, both foul and fair, about the way one should conduct life and party. In general, paladins who take this oath abide by the following principles: </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>The Party Don't Stop.</i></b> Every occasion deserves celebration, and everyone should be invited.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Work Hard, Party Hard.</i></b> Without planning and effort, a good bacchanal has no momentousness. Bring your “A” game to events.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Fight for Your Right to Party.</i></b> Those who would stand in your way need to be reminded what it's like to have a good time, or failing that, be circumvented.</p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Glorious Radiance.</i></b> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to radiate sunlight. While this effect is active, you shed bright light out to a radius of 30 feet. Additionally, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your paladin level + your Charisma modifier. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, you can use your reaction to deal 5 points of radiant damage to it. This effect lasts for 1 hour, ending early if the hit points are expended or you dismiss it on your turn (no action required). When you reach 11th level, the effect deals 10 points of radiant damage, and at 17th level, it deals 15 points of radiant damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Solar Flare.</i></b> As an action, you can emit a blinding flash of light using your Channel Divinity. When you do so, each creature you choose within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
