			<p>For centuries, the pinnacle of mechanized vehicles was the apparatus of the crab, a singular device capable of exploring inhospitable environments, from the sea floor to lava-strewn volcanic fields. However, ambitious craftsmen from the Mechanauts' Guild have drawn up designs for a new vehicle, mightier and more customizable than the old apparatus. This device is a walking tank, equipped with savage fists, scuttling legs, and climate control enhancementsâ€”a vehicle to dwarf all others, a true feat of engineering.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 3rd level, you complete the frame of a Mechanaut's Apparatus, with ample room for upgrades and improvements. Its blueprints are based on the <i>apparatus of the crab</i>* , but you can model your apparatus after any beast or as a humanoid figure. (*A. of Kwalish)</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Apparatus Statistics.</b> The statistics of your apparatus are given in the Mechanaut's Apparatus stat block. The apparatus's Armor Class is based on your Intelligence modifier and its hit points are based on your craftsman level.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Customizing the Apparatus.</b> Your apparatus comes with two installed masterwork weapons, which you can modify with masterwork properties or replace with different weapons when you finish a long rest. Only one installed weapon can be ranged. Furthermore, you can only load or reload an installed ranged weapon by using your action while you are inside the apparatus (or two actions if the weapon has the Mounted property). Your apparatus is always proficient with its installed weapons, and can use masterwork weapons with Master and Legendary properties.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Repairing the Apparatus.</b> When your apparatus drops to 0 hit points, it can't move or act, but can be repaired. You can spend 1 minute restoring the apparatus's ability to move at half speed, which it loses if it takes damage again before it is repaired. </p>
            <p class="indent">You can repair your apparatus at the end of a short rest by spending your Hit Dice, causing it to regain hit points as if it had taken a short rest. When you finish a long rest, you can repair your apparatus, causing it to regain all its hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to repair your apparatus. If your apparatus is lost, you can build a new one for 400 gp</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Entering and Exiting the Apparatus.</b> A creature can enter or exit the apparatus by using half its movement. While within the apparatus, a creature has total cover from effects originating outside of it. Your armor properties have no effect while you are within the apparatus. Only one Medium or Small creature can be in the apparatus at a time.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Piloting the Apparatus.</b> A creature that is inside the apparatus can pilot it; the apparatus acts on its pilot's turn. Any creature piloting the apparatus can command it to move on its turn (no action required). When you pilot the apparatus, you can use your action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. You can also command it to use a reaction, using your own reaction to do so. </p>
            <p>Only one creature can pilot the apparatus at a time. The pilot takes half the damage the apparatus takes.</p>
            <p class="indent">While you are outside the apparatus, you can command the apparatus to wait or follow you. While following, it moves on its turn to remain within 30 feet of you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Attacking with the Apparatus.</b> When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a firearm that has the Scatter property, you can reroll the lowest damage die, and you must use the new roll, even if the new roll is lower than the original.</p>
