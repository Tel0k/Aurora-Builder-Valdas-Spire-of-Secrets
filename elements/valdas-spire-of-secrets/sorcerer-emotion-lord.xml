		<description>
			<p>Whenever you are filled with heartbreak, terror, or the depths of sorrow, waves of arcane energy spill forth from you. You might have found the spark of magic when great tragedy struck or while you shook with rage, or it may have always lingered in the back of your soul, only erupting forth when you lost control. However it originated, controlling your emotions and knowing yourself is key to manipulating your deep well of arcane energy. To lose focus, to be governed by your emotions, allows all your magic to flow through you in spectacular and uncontrollable fashion. But to have control of yourself, and true understanding of your soul, grants you a breadth of magic few can hope to equal.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Emotional Spells table. The list of spells you know from this table changes with your predominant emotional state. These emotions should be informed by your character's history as much as the current situation; however, the GM decides whether or not a situation is appropriate to inspire a specific emotional state. For example, a pitched life-or-death battle is unlikely to inspire love. If your emotions would be uncertain, choose this state randomly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you but doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can't be replaced when you gain a level in this class.</p>
