        <description>
        <p><em>Prerequisite: Firearms Character Option</em></p>
        <p>A glass falls, clattering to the floor, and the tavern grows silent. A dwarf with a deep scowl, dripping with freshly spilled beer, leers at a drunken nearby orc and fingers for a pair of revolvers at his waist.</p>
        <p class="indent">High on a hillside, carefully concealed beneath foliage and stones, a rifleman steadies her breathing and adjusts her scope, acquiring her target and patiently awaiting the moment to strike.</p>
        <p class="indent">Risk is in a gunslinger's blood. They are bold renegades, bucking tradition and forging a new path with dangerous and inelegant firearms. Gunslingers are infamous for surviving by their wits, relying on split-second timing and a considerable amount of luck to survive.</p>
        <h4>GUTS AND GUNPOWDER</h4>
        <p>Black powder is not for the faint of heart. Its thunderous applause is volatile and imprecise—a barely controlled explosion directed at an enemy. Only the truly fearless seek to master it, for one must be mad or have nerves of steel to weather the risk of its use. But those who call themselves gunslingers are fearless combatants, hurling death from their guns in a roaring cacophony. Adapted for shootouts, gunslingers are mobile and daring, knowing that life or death hangs on snap decision-making and one's own mettle.</p>
        <h4>DANGEROUS OUTSIDERS</h4>
        <p>A gunslinger's explosive lifestyle lends well to wandering and adventuring. Gunslingers will often shoot first and ask questions later, an attitude which earns them few friends and bountiful enemies. In their travels, most gunslingers are secretive and take great lengths to go unnoticed, lest they be spotted by old foes with scores to settle.</p>
        <p class="indent">Yet, their skills are not unneeded. Anyone requiring protection or revenge of their own can count on a gunslinger to be in need of an odd job when they roll into town. After all, skill with a gun is always in demand somewhere.</p>
        <h4>CREATING A GUNSLINGER</h4>
        <p>When creating your gunslinger, consider where firearms fit in the campaign's world and what the common perceptions are of those who use them. If firearms are the norm, your gunslinger might be a mercenary or militia fighter. If firearms are rare, your gunslinger might be one of a kind, a trailblazer in new types of warfare.</p>
        <p class="indent">It's also not unusual for a gunslinger to be haunted by their past. Did some event drive you to the gun and motivate you to travel? Is there a bounty on your head in one or more areas? Do you have any old enemies that seek you for revenge?</p>
        <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
        <p>To make a gunslinger quickly, follow these suggestions. Make Dexterity and Constitution your highest ability scores. If you plan to choose the Gun Tank creed, instead make Strength your highest ability score. Lastly, choose any background, preferably one that emphasizes your familiarity with firearms and penchant for risk-taking.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You adopt a particular style of gunfighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">AKIMBO</h5>
			<p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting with firearms, you don't take a penalty to the damage of the second attack.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">BULLSEYE</h5>
			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to ranged attack rolls you make with firearms. The weapon must have the Sighted property or have a normal range of 80 feet or longer to gain this benefit. This benefit doesn't stack with the Archery fighting style.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">DUELIST</h5>
			<p>While you are wielding a firearm in one hand and nothing in the other, if you make a ranged weapon attack and exceed the target's AC by 5 or more, you deal one extra die of weapon damage. You can only use this ability once per round.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">SHOTGUNNER</h5>
			<p>When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a firearm that has the Scatter property, you can reroll the lowest damage die, and you must use the new roll, even if the new roll is worse than the original.</p>
