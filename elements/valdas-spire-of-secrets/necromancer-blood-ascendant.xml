        <description>
            <p>Necromantic might comes in many forms, but a singular, ancient source is the blood curse of vampirism. Though it promises much—immortality, agility, charm—it comes paired with insidious drawbacks, from the stinging burn of sunlight to a perpetual thirst for blood. Necromancers that wish to capture a measure of this power without suffering its myriad weaknesses perform a special ritual with vampiric blood in order to become Blood Ascendants. In doing so, they fall deathly pale and lose their reflection within mirrors, but learn to slowly pry out vampiric powers without fully succumbing to the all-devouring curse.</p>

            <p>Starting when you choose this ambition at 3rd level, you can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid, attempting to bring them under your necromantic control. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it becomes enthralled by you. On a success, you can't use this feature against the creature for 24 hours. While enthralled, the creature is charmed by you and follows your commands. It remains enthralled until a remove curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, you use this feature again, or you release the creature as an action.</p>
            <p class="indent">An enthralled creature counts against the total number of thralls under your control and the total CR of thralls you can control. If the creature is of a higher CR than the total CR of thralls you control, you can't enthrall it. You can release thralls under your control as a part of the action used to enthrall a creature.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your action and expend 15 Charnel Touch points to transform for up to 1 hour, or until you drop to 0 hit points or revert on your turn as an action. Anything you are wearing transforms with you, but objects you are carrying fall to the ground in your space. Choose one of the following transformations: </p>
            <p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Bat.</em></strong> You transform into a Tiny bat. While in bat form, you can't speak, your walking speed is 5 feet, and you have a flying speed of 30 feet. Your statistics, other than your size and speed, are unchanged.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Mist.</em></strong> You transform into a Medium cloud of mist. While in mist form, you can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. You are weightless, have a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, you can do so without squeezing, and you can't pass through water. You have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p>
