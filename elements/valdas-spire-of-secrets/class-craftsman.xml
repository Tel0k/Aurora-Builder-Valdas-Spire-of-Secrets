		<description>
			<p>A burly dwarf brings her hammer down on a glowing hunk of steel, launching a shower of sparks into the air. The room resonates with the sound of metal impacting metal, while the bright, hot piece of steel in her tongs begins to take shape.</p>
			<p class="indent">An elf threads a needle with an impossibly thin metallic wire, preparing to set the stitches into what looks to be leather armor, but made of dragon's hide. Once satisfied with the measurements, he proceeds with a flurry of dexterous needlework.</p>
			<p class="indent">A gnome with an intricate set of goggles examines the stock for her latest work: a portable ballista. She examines the gearing and loading crank, ensures the tension on the bowstring, and scans the bolt rail for imperfections. She smiles, for she knows her work is without flaw.</p>
			<p class="indent">Craftsmen are virtuoso artisans and genius inventors. Not content merely creating masterwork pieces of weapons and armor, they invent and engineer ingenious devices and singularly deadly weapons.</p>
			<h4>Master of Craft</h4>
			<p>Artisans of all types are an integral part of every culture: buildings must be erected, pots must be sent to the kiln, tools must be forged. Despite their pervasiveness, master craftsmen are still as rare as they are prized. These artisans, creators, and inventors can smith items of mythic quality, and can solve most any problem simply by using the right tool and the appropriate amount of force.</p>
			<h4>Secret of Steel</h4>
			<p>Adventuring craftsmen come in many varieties, but nearly all leverage their advanced knowledge of metallurgy, smelting, and construction to forge arms and armor rarely seen, even by other adventurers. The smiths test their schematics and designs themselves, building prototypes and experimental gear that can later be refined into mass-produced items.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A CRAFTSMAN</h4>
			<p>When you create your craftsman, the most important thing to consider is your crafting expertise. Though all craftsmen of adventuring stock can stitch leather armor, forge weapons, and tinker with magic items, only those who dedicate themselves to a single craft can attain legendary works. Each type of craftsman, from the practical to the wildly eccentric, have their place, but no craftsman can specialize in everything.</p>
			<p class="indent">Moreover, few craftsmen are self-taught. Most learn the finer points of their craft under the tutelage of a master artisan (whether or not their master was a craftsman, in the conventional sense). Did you study under a master, and if so, what drove you to apprentice underneath them?</p>
			<p class="indent">Lastly, consider how you view your work. Are you pragmatic, viewing your creations as tools to serve a purpose? Are you artistic, striving to craft pieces of unrivaled beauty and perfection? Or are you experimental, tinkering and building with wild abandon to break new ground and innovate on established norms?</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a craftsman quickly by following these suggestions. Make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Next, select Athletics and Investigation as your skills. Finally, choose a background befitting of your history of craftsmanship.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 2nd level, you begin to learn the deeper intricacies of weapon and armor craftsmanship.</p>
			<h5>MASTERWORK EQUIPMENT</h5>
			<p>As a craftsman, you are capable of creating weapons and armor of the utmost quality; such creations are known as masterwork items. To create a masterwork version of an item, add 50 gp to the cost in materials you pay to craft the item. Masterwork weapons you create have a +1 bonus to attack rolls. A magic weapon that adds a bonus to your attack and damage rolls doesn't add this bonus to attack rolls.</p>
			<h5>MASTERWORK PROPERTIES</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Properties</td><td>Craftsman Level</td><td>Cost</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>Apprentice</td><td>2nd</td><td>—</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Journeyman</td><td>5th</td><td>100 gp</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Master</td><td>11th</td><td>250 gp</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Legendary</td><td>17th</td><td>400 gp</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h5>MASTERWORK PROPERTIES</h5>
			<p>Masterwork weapons and armor can be modified with masterwork properties, advanced modifications that transform them into truly unique weapons and armor. Masterwork properties are separated into 4 levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, and Legendary. You can apply any number of Apprentice properties to a masterwork weapon, or up to three Apprentice properties to a masterwork suit of armor. Additionally, you can apply one Journeyman, one Master, and one Legendary property to each masterwork item.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you add a Master or Legendary property to an item, only you can use it.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>Damage Steps</h5>
                		<p>If a masterwork property increases or decreases a weapon's damage, it is moved up or down one step on the following scale, down to a minimum of 1d4:</p>
                		<br />
                		<p class="indent">1d4 → 1d6 → 1d8 → 1d10 → 1d12 or 2d6</p>
                		<br />
                		<p>Further increases add a +1 bonus to the weapon's damage roll.</p>
                		<p class="indent">If the weapon being modified has 2 damage dice (such as a greatsword or a firearm), the scale is instead:</p>
                		<p class="indent">2d4 → 2d4 + 1 → 2d6 → 2d6 + 1 → 2d8 → 2d8 + 1 → 2d10 → 2d10 + 1 → 2d12</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>Changing Weapon Ranges</h5>
                <p>A ranged weapon’s long range is either three times its normal range or four times its normal range, depending on the type of projectile it fires. When a masterwork property changes a weapon’s normal range, change the long range by three or four times the amount, as appropriate to the weapon.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can’t apply a weapon property if it would reduce a ranged weapon’s normal range to 0 feet, and you can’t remove the Ammunition or Thrown property of a ranged weapon.</p>
			</div>
            <h5>MODIFYING EQUIPMENT</h5>
			<p>Using the Active Crafting feature, you can modify a weapon or suit of armor when you take a long rest. This allows you to do the following:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Improving Equipment.</strong>You can make any nonmagical weapon or suit of armor masterwork for a cost of 50 gp in materials.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Adding Masterwork Properties.</strong>Adding masterwork properties of Journeyman level or higher requires a cost in gold pieces and also requires you to be of a high enough level in this class, as shown in the Masterwork Properties table. When you learn a new level of masterwork properties, you can apply a property from that level to a masterwork item at no cost.</p>
			<p class="indent">Check the Weapons Exceptions sidebar later in this chapter before adding masterwork properties to a weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you modify the properties of a masterwork weapon, you can change its damage type to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, if its damage was already one of these types.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>WEAPON EXCEPTIONS</h5>
				<p>Some weapons, in the name of verisimilitude, have unusual balancing that makes them slightly stronger or weaker compared to weapons a craftsman might usually craft. If you modify one of these weapons as a craftsman, first remove any of the weapon's Special properties, then check following rules:</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Assault Rifle.</strong> Increase the weapon's damage to 2d6 + 1 and decrease its reload to 10.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Handaxe.</strong> Decrease the weapon's damage to 1d4.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Hunting Rifle.</strong> Increase the weapon's damage to 2d6 + 1.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Bayonet, Whip.</strong> Increase the weapon's damage to 1d6.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Blowgun, Bolas, Bomb, Net.</strong> This weapon can't be modified by masterwork properties.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Boomerang, Doomerang, Throwing Dagger.</strong>  Add the Aerodynamic masterwork property.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Catchpole, Trident.</strong> Increase the weapon's damage to 1d8.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Gatling Gun.</strong> Increase the weapon's damage to 2d8 + 1, and decrease its reload to 10.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Handgun, Revolver.</strong> Decrease the weapon's range to 50/200 ft.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Javelin.</strong> Decrease the weapon's range to 20/60 ft.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Lance.</strong> Add the Two-Handed property and decrease the weapon's damage to 1d8.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Light Cannon.</strong> Increase the weapon's damage to 2d12 + 1.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Longbow.</strong> Decrease the weapon's range to 100/400 ft.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Magnum, Explosive Magnum.</strong> Add the Two-Handed property and increase the weapon's range to 100/400 ft.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Musket, Volley Gun.</strong>. Increase the weapon's damage to 2d8 + 1.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Parlor Gun.</strong> Increase the weapon's damage to 2d4 + 1.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Rocket Launcher.</strong> Increase the weapon's damage to 2d12 + 1 and add the Mounted property.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Removing Properties.</strong> You can remove any properties of a masterwork item, including those a weapon had when you first created it. You can't remove a property from an item that is a prerequisite for another of the item's properties. If you replace a property of Journeyman level or higher with a property of the same level over the same long rest, you can do so without an additional cost in materials.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>CHANGING WEAPON RANGES</h5>
				<p>A ranged weapon's long range is either three times its normal range or four times its normal range, depending on the type of projectile it fires. When a masterwork property changes a weapon's normal range, change the long range by three or four times the amount, as appropriate to the weapon.</p>
				<p class="indent">You can't apply a weapon property if it would reduce a ranged weapon's normal range to 0 feet, and you can't remove the Ammunition or Thrown property of a ranged weapon.</p>
			</div>
			<h5>CRAFTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is the primary ability you use when crafting items. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for items that you craft.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Masterwork save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			</center>

		<description>
			<p>At 20th level, you complete an object of unparalleled majesty. You work feverishly for a period of 30 days to create a single magic item of very rare or legendary rarity. This item is tied to your very soul: regardless of type, you are always considered attuned to it, and no other creature can attune to it while you are alive. This item doesn't count against your maximum number of attuned items, and you ignore all attunement requirements for the item. As long as you are on the same plane of existence as your item, you can use a bonus action to call it to your hand or onto your body (as appropriate). You can only craft a Magnum Opus once.</p>
