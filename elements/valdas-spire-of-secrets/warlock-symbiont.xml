			<p>Though most warlocks forge pacts with distant, intangible entities, your patron is a physical being of incomprehensible powerâ€”a being that dwells inside your very body. This arrangement was struck in the spirit of symbiosis: your patron, which resembles a muscular, living ichor, requires a mortal dwelling, and you in turn may profit from its magic. You can even draw your patron out from where it resides in your blood, causing it to seep forth onto your skin until you are a monstrous hybrid of ichor, replete with claws and teeth to rend your foes asunder.</p>

			<p><em>1st-level Symbiont feature</em></p>
			<p>Starting when you choose this patron at 1st level, you can draw out your Symbiont, which proceeds to coat your body in a living slime exoskeleton. You can undergo this transformation or reverse it as a bonus action on your turn. While transformed, you can't cast spells, but transforming doesn't break your concentration or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast. While transformed, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>The Flesh.</b> When you aren't wearing armor, your base AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can use The Flesh to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use The Flesh.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>The Claws.</b> You sprout a set of wicked claws, which you can use as natural melee weapons to make claw attacks. You are proficient with your claw attacks and can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength, for their attack and damage rolls. On a hit, your claws deal 1d8 slashing damage, which counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, your claws count as pact weapons for warlock class features.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Extra Attack.</b> Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice with your claws, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
