        <description>
            <p>Necromantic might comes in many forms, but a singular, ancient source is the blood curse of vampirism. Though it promises much—immortality, agility, charm—it comes paired with insidious drawbacks, from the stinging burn of sunlight to a perpetual thirst for blood. Necromancers that wish to capture a measure of this power without suffering its myriad weaknesses perform a special ritual with DESPOTIC blood in order to become Overlords. In doing so, they fall deathly pale and lose their reflection within mirrors, but learn to slowly pry out DESPOTIC powers without fully succumbing to the all-devouring curse.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you can grant a boon to minions by empowering them with your own potency. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend any number of points from your Charnel Touch pool to empower each of your thralls within 30 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, those thralls gain a +1 bonus to their attack rolls, damage rolls, and AC for every 5 points expended, up to a maximum of +3.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. Your desire for control has warped your transformation, turning you into a tyrant lich. Your flesh and bone rapidly decay, reducing your features to nothing more than two glowing dots beneath your hood. You gain the following features in addition to the Lichdom feature:</p>
            <p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Immortal Rule.</em></strong>  If you drop to 0 hit points, you can choose to possess a nearby body, instead of beginning the process of reforming at your phylactery. When you do so, choose an unconscious humanoid or the corpse of one that has died within the last minute that is within 120 feet of you to possess (a creature warded by a <i>protection from evil and good</i> or <i>magic circle</i> spell can't be possessed).</p>
            <p class="indent"> Once you possess a body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. If the body has 0 hit points when you possess it, its type becomes undead and it regains 50 hit points, up to its hit point maximum. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.</p>
            <p class="indent"> If you possess the body of an unconscious creature, the creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC after 8 hours, and it repeats the save every 8 hours thereafter until the effect ends. On a success, you are ejected from the body and begin the process of reforming at your phylactery. You are also ejected if the body dies or you choose to leave it as an action. Once you've possessed a creature in this way, you can't possess it again using this feature.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Tyrant's Influence.</em></strong> You can expend 25 points from your Charnel Touch pool to cast the <i>dominate beast</i> spell without expending a spell slot. You can also expend 30 points to cast the <i>dominate person</i> spell, or 60 points to cast the <i>dominate monster</i> spell without expending a spell slot.</p>
