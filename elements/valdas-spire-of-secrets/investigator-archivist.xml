			<p>Though most investigators fill their grimoires with hard-won knowledge borne from encounters with supernatural threats, some prefer to do bookkeeping instead. Such archivists seek to accumulate knowledge, moreso than trinkets, by spending untold hours digging through disparate tomes of occult secrets and compiling them into encyclopedic texts on the supernatural. Through their research, archivists become academic masters of the arcane and priceless reservoirs of obscure knowledge.</p>

Whenever you witness a spell being cast or investigate a magical effect, you can always identify the spell that was cast, the magic item responsible, or the monster which produced the effect. However, this ability fails to identify spells, magic items, and monsters that are utterly unique or are otherwise not recorded in arcane texts.</p>
