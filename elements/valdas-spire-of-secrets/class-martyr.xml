		<description>
			<p>Squalid masses draw close around a young dwarf in spotless clothing. He touches each person in turn, healing injuries, curing illnesses, and restoring hope.</p>
			<p class="indent">A ragged tiefling speaks in a crowded square. As if in response, dark clouds gather over her head and the earth trembles at her words.</p>
			<p class="indent">A mad king spits and swears from his throne at imperial guards who have fled or been slain. A lone dragonborn stands before him, solemnly preparing herself for divinely demanded regicide.</p>
			<p class="indent">Martyrs are implements of the gods, hand-picked to spill their blood in service of a divine cause. Such an end is inevitable, for once a martyr is chosen, their fate is fixed in the heavens.</p>
			<h4>FATED TO DIE</h4>
			<p>Martyrs are chosen by the gods as prophets, oracles, great priests, and liberators. However, regardless of how much good they might accomplish in their lives, the end must always be the same: a glorious death, to be remembered in legend.</p>
			<p class="indent">No matter the circumstance, a martyr cannot avoid their destiny. While some martyrs gladly accept their holy approbation, others struggle against it. However, from the moment the gods choose their martyr, they shall intervene in the martyr's fate, pulling them inexorably toward their cause. The gods will settle for a lesser martyr if they must—if the one chosen is unwilling to follow their path—but they always prefer to uplift their martyr to the heights of sainthood before their inevitable demise.</p>
			<h4>BLOOD OF THE MARTYR</h4>
			<p>Martyrs grow more powerful the closer they are to death, and those that spill their own blood evoke waves of divine energy. In the view of the gods, such hardship is necessary to lay the foundation for a story that will live on in history.</p>
			<p class="indent">Paradoxically, martyrs are protected from death's precipice even as they are edged closer toward it. Every torment and persecution suffered by them is weighed with equal moments of respite offered by the gods. The gods do not mean to kill their charge early; a martyr should meet their fate only at the preordained time and place.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A MARTYR</h4>
			<p>As you create a martyr, think about the moment you were chosen by the gods and your burden was placed upon you. Were you visited by an angelic host or a god disguised as a mortal? Did you quietly hear a divine voice in your ear, as stigmata formed on your body? Was your soul violently dragged to the Upper (or Lower) Planes for an audience with the gods?</p>
			<p class="indent">Consider the life you led before you were ordained for martyrdom. Were you a wicked soul, purified and redeemed to undergo this task? Were you already a warrior, adventurer, or cleric in service of the gods? Also consider how you reacted. Did you accept the task and your inevitable destiny, or did you run from it? Are you still running?</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>To build a martyr quickly, follow these suggestions: Constitution should be your highest ability score. Your next highest ability score should be Strength if you choose a Burden, such as the Burden of Revolution, which focuses on melee combat, or Wisdom if you choose one focused on spellcasting. Choose any background.</p>
			<h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
			<p>As an martyr, you gain the following class features.</p>

			<p>As a martyr, you have been predestined by the gods to perish for a great cause; there is no greater glory in death, and no greater joy in the afterlife. However, it is not yet your time. Starting at 1st level, when you fall to 0 hit points and begin to make death saving throws, you must fail 5 saving throws to die. Additionally, if a spell has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn't need material components to cast the spell on you.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can leverage the power of your suffering to cast divine magic.</p>
			<h5>CASTING SPELLS</h5>
			<p>To cast one of your martyr spells of 1st level or higher, you must lose hit points to create and expend a spell slot greater than or equal to that spell's level. The number of hit points is listed on the Hit Points Spellcasting table and can't be reduced or avoided. You don't make Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells as a result of losing these hit points.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Martyr table shows the maximum level of spell slot you can create. </p>
			<p class="indent">The Spell Uses column of the Martyr table shows how many spells you can cast. When you expend hit points to cast a spell, you expend one of these uses. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

			<h5>PREPARING SPELLS</h5>
			<p>You prepare the list of martyr spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the martyr spell list. When you do so, choose a number of martyr spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your martyr level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). Spells you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Max Spell Level column for your level. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<h5>HEALING MAGIC</h5>
			<p>Because your power is derived from mortal suffering, you can't regain hit points from any spell you cast.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your martyr spells, since your power originates in the devotion used to overcome your trials and tribulations. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a martyr spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

			<p>At 20th level, you have at last reached your predestination: you will die in eternal glory. You can use your action to become immune to all damage for 10 minutes. For this duration, you can't be blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned, restrained, or rendered unconscious. You have advantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, during this duration, you can cast the <i>wish</i> spell once, without expending a spell slot or hit points. If you use the spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell, the stress of casting it doesn't reduce your Strength or cause you to take necrotic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the end of this duration, you die. No force short of divine intervention can prevent your death, and you can't be returned to life by any means.</p>
