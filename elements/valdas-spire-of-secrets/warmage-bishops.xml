        <description>
            <p>The House of Bishops adopts warmages with true arcane potential, expanding on essential magic principles with true spellcasting. Such warmages might be easily confused for wizards or Warmages, for they don the same garb and wield many of the same spells, but the warmage focus on perfection still holds precedence over garnering a vast array of spells.</p>

            <p>When you choose this house at 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells more potent than cantrips.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>SPELL SLOTS.</b> The Bishop Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>SPELL KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL OR HIGHER.</b> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the conjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Bishop Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a conjuration or evocation spell of your choice, except for the spells learned at 8th, and 14th level, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a conjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th or 14th level.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>WARMAGE EDGE.</b> You can add additional damage with your warmage spells of 1st level or higher using your Warmage Edge feature, as if they were cantrips. You can’t add Warmage Edge damage to the spell <i>magic missile</i>.</p>
