        <p>The wide-open ocean, the salty breeze, and the freedom of a shipâ€”these are the things a corsair values more than anything else.

        <p>At 3rd level, you can replace one of your attacks with an attempt to steal an item being carried by another creature. You can't attempt to steal an object that is being worn as clothing or armor, nor can you steal an object that is being held in one of the target's hands. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, opposed by the target's AC. On a success, you successfully steal that object. You must have a free hand to use this ability.</p>
