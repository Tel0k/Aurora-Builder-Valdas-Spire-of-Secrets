		<description>
			<p>The Way of Street Fighting is an urban discipline founded on necessity, whose blindingly fast, unique brand of martial arts has been honed and perfected in back-alley brawls and tournaments alike. Monks who adopt this relatively new technique place comparatively little value on spiritual enlightenment and karmic balance; the thrill of split-second timing, rapid combos, and decisive knock-outs drive them to become the best combatants in the world.</p>

			<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain bonuses for successful consecutive hits on a single target. On your turn, you gain a +2 bonus to the attack rolls of your unarmed strikes for each hit that you have made on that target on your turn, to a maximum of +6. This bonus resets to 0 if you take damage on your turn.</p>

			<p>At 11th level, you have memorized and mastered patterns of discrete movements that unlock your ki, allowing you to use the following special moves:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Ki Blast.</strong> You can channel your ki into a blast of energy. As an action, you can expend 2 ki points to make a ranged spell attack (using your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus) against a creature you can see within 120 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 6d8 + half your monk level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Uppercut.</strong> Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to perform an uppercut. Make an unarmed strike as a bonus action. On a hit, if the target is Large or smaller and doesn't have all of its hit points, it takes damage as normal and is then knocked off its feet and falls prone.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Whirlwind Strike.</strong> Whenever you make a melee attack on your turn against a creature you can see, you can spend 1 ki point to lunge up to 15 feet toward your target before making the attack. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You can perform this movement even if it causes you to travel through the air, though you fall after making the attack if you do not land on solid ground.</p>
