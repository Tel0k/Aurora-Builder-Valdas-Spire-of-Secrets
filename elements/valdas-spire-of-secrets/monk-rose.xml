  		    <p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your spirit has taken on a floral aspect, causing you to smell of roses at all times. You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks relating to love or romance. Furthermore, creatures with the Keen Smell trait (or similar abilities) have disadvantage on ability checks made to track you.</p>

  			<p>At 3rd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to produce a vibrant eruption of flower petals which obscures the target's vision. Until the end of the target's next turn, it can see out to 5 feet but is blind beyond this radius. The flower petals follow the creature when it moves unless the creature takes the Dash action or moves more than 40 feet on its turn.</p>

  			<p>At 6th level, you can perform a special technique that allows you to disappear in a blizzard of rose petals. Whenever you use your Flurry of Blows, you can teleport up to 10 feet in any direction. This movement can take place before, during, or after the attacks, but can't be split into two moves.</p>

  			<p>By 11th level, you can manifest the love represented by the rose in a faintly glowing aura. When you finish a long rest, choose one of the following auras, which lasts until you use this feature to choose a different one. The aura radiates 5 feet from you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Pink.</strong> The color of gratitude, attuning to the pink rose turns a good deed into its own reward. You can use the Help action as a bonus action to assist an ally within your aura.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Red.</strong> The color of desire, attuning to the red rose fills you with burning passion. A friendly creature other than you within the aura can use its bonus action when it hits with an attack to deal an extra 1d6 damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>White.</strong> The color of purity, attuning to the white rose aligns your ki with the heavens. When a friendly creature other than you ends its turn within your aura, it gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>
