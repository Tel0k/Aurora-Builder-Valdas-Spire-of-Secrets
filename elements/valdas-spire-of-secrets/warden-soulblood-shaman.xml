            <p>The ancestral spirits called you by starlight to enact their will on the world, to protect their descendants, and to safeguard their resting places. You are a Soulblood Shaman, a manipulator of soul and ascetic of primal magic. Your community looks to you as a leader as well as a vital connection to the afterlife, for if you play your role, they too will join their ancestors in the great beyond.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting when you hear this call at 3rd level, you can channel your ancient insights into magic.</p>
		    <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
		    <p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
		    <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
		    <p>The Soulblood Shaman Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
		    <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
		    <p>You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation or transmutation spells on the druid spell list.</p>
		    <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Soulblood Shaman Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
		    <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
		    <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the druid spells you know with another spell of your choice from the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
		    <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
		    <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since you channel your magic through a connection to the great beyond. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
		    <center>
			    <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

If you spend 1 minute in contemplation when you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check, you can consult a host of ancestor spirits to gain advantage on the roll. You can't use this ability when your ancestors wouldn't have appropriate knowledge or guidance, such as if you try to understand cutting-edge alchemy.</p>
