			<p>The Calibarons know, better than most, that gunpowder is the single greatest invention ever created by mortals. A sword may let a skilled wielder lay a giant low and magic may let the savvy and the blessed stand up to the gods, but only a gun will let a common man put a dragon in its place.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b>Akimbo.</b> When you engage in two-weapon fighting with firearms, you do not take a penalty to the damage of the second attack.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Bullseye.</b> You gain a +2 bonus to ranged attack rolls you make using firearms. The weapon must have the Sighted property or have a normal range of 80 feet or longer to gain this effect. This effect does not stack with the Archery fighting style.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Duelist.</b> While you are wielding a firearm in one hand and nothing in the other, if you make a ranged weapon attack and exceed the target's AC by 5 or more, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. You can only use this ability once per round.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Shotgunner.</b> When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a firearm that has the Scatter property, you can reroll the lowest damage die, and you must use the new roll, even if the new roll is lower than the original.</p>

You can use your action to attach this launcher to a two-handed ranged weapon with the Firearm property or remove it from one.

            <p class="indent">You can use your action to fire the launcher at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC, taking 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you fire the launcher, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
