			<p>Technicolor Magic witches draw their power from the friendships they find around them. They have a penchant for collecting adorable animals of all shapes and sizes, which they will never endanger, no matter how dire the situation. Above all, these witches are defined by their relentlessly positive outlook, which empowers their arcana and spurs on their allies.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 3rd level, you gain a hex that inspires your allies with an uplifting speech or an encouraging musical number. As an action, you can grant each willing creature you can see that can see you within 30 feet of you a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + half your witch level. These temporary hit points last until the end of your next turn.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting when you choose this craft at 3rd level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks you make to befriend beasts. You can use your Charisma, instead of Wisdom, for these checks if the creature is Small or smaller. If you adopt a beast as a pet, you can temporarily dismiss it into an extradimensional space, as you would a familiar. </p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you can weave a small bracelet of string, beads, or some other inexpensive material. You can always determine the location of a creature wearing one of these bracelets, as long as you and it are on the same plane of existence. You can target the creature with spells and effects as if you could see it, even if the target is obscured from your view.</p>

            <p>Starting at 10th level, you can leverage your bonds of friendship for protection. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of friendly creatures within 5 feet of you, potentially causing the attack to miss you instead.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at 14th level, you can redeem your foes, instead of slaying them. When a hostile creature you can see is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to protect the creature from further harm. The creature is stable but unconscious until it regains any hit points. When the creature awakens, any magical effect causing it to be charmed, cursed, frightened, or possessed ends. Furthermore, the creature loses one of its Bonds or Flaws that inspired it to be hostile toward you.</p>
