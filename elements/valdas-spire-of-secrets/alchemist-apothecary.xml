            <p>Many practically minded alchemists assume the role of the apothecary, for adventuring parties always need a healer, and clerics might be in short supply. During their downtime, such alchemists have a marketable skill to depend upon for income and can do an indisputable amount of good with their knowledge. Apothecaries are constantly at work studying potions and herbology, preferring to learn how to mend the body, rather than destroy it.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 2nd level, you can mix your bomb's contents with analgesic oil, changing it into a painkiller bomb. A painkiller bomb deals no damage and doesn't have a blast radius. On a hit, roll damage as normal; the target instead gains temporary hit points which last for 1 minute equal to the total damage roll. You can target a willing creature with this bomb without making an attack roll. Once you throw one of these bombs, you can't throw another one for 1 minute.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, you've developed a chemical mechanism to deliver potions more effectively to distant allies. You can use your action to hurl a potion at a willing or unconscious creature within 20 feet of you. The target gains the potion's benefit as if it had consumed the potion normally.</p>

            <p>By 10th level, you've tested out your own tolerances to painkillers such that you can take a small measure regularly without ill effect. Whenever you drink a potion that has the effect of restoring your hit points (even if you already have all of your hit points), you gain advantage on saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p>

            <p>Starting at 18th level, your medicines are potent enough to rouse the dead. By using your action to mix 500 gp worth of diamond dust into a <i>potion of superior healing</i> or a <i>potion of supreme healing</i>, you create a <i>potion of raise dead</i>. If you use your action to pour this concoction on a Humanoid corpse that has been dead no longer than 10 days, the target gains the effect of the <i>raise dead spell</i>.</p>
