			<p>Sorcerers gain their powers in mysterious ways that they seldom have control over. You are the reincarnation of a legendary hero, known to have slain many terrible foes. Being called back to life, be it by the gods, a very powerful mage, or a persistent curse on your soul, has left the indelible mark of sorcery upon you and awakened your ancient instincts for battle.</p>

            <p>The power of your previous life grants you the ability to learn spells that other sorcerers might never manifest. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the following, which don’t count against your total number of spells known: <i>arc blade</i>, <i>burning blade</i>, <i>caustic blade</i>, <i>force weapon</i>, and <i>frigid blade</i>.</p>
            <p class="indent">You also learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Heroic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you but doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.</p>
