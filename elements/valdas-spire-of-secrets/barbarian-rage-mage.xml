		<description>
			<p>Most barbarians who possess the spark of arcane talent never realize it, introspection not always being a barbaric strength. Those who find this spark, however, might learn to channel their brute ferocity through magic, and embark on the Path of the Rage Mage. Through their rage-fueled arcane might, such a barbarian possesses a uniquely calamitous fury, merging physical prowess with spell slinging in a warpath of fire, blades, and blood.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Also at 3rd level, your rage manifests as a surge of arcane power. While you are raging, you can cast and concentrate on spells. Additionally, casting a spell on your turn counts as attacking a hostile creature for the purpose of sustaining your rage.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Rage Mage Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level or higher. To cast one of these spells, you must be raging and expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know three 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation or transmutation spells on the sorcerer spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Rage Mage Spellcasting table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless youâ€™re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
