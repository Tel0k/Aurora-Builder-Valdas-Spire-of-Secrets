			<p>This spell teleports a creature to your location. Choose a creature known to you within range as the target of this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Charisma saving throw to resist this effect. The target is placed at a location of your choice within 30 feet of you. You choose if the target is sitting, standing, prone, or bound with nearby restraints. At the end of the spell's duration, you can choose whether the target remains at your location or is teleported back to the location from which it was abducted.</p>

Immediately after you take damage while this spell is active, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to that damage type until this spell ends or until you use this ability again to gain resistance to a different damage type.

On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, except that any damage dealt by the attack is lightning damage instead of its normal type.

			<p>For the duration, a willing target’s body parts (fingers, legs, tail, and even its head) can be harmlessly severed from its body. It takes no damage from such dismemberment, as long as the cut removing the body part is swift and leaves a clean cut. The target’s head remains alive and conscious, and parts connected to it also remain alive. All severed body parts become inanimate, but do not begin decomposition for the spell’s duration. Any of the target’s severed body parts that are removed during this spell’s duration can be held back to the stump, which instantly causes the part to knit to the stump, restoring the body part.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the end of the duration, severed body parts become permanent, and the target dies if vital organs have not been reattached to its head.</p>

This blood print is unique to the particular creature to whom the blood belongs, but you can determine the creature’s kind (such as human, gnoll, deer, or fire giant) by examining the general shape. A print can be preserved by pressing a sheet of paper against it. If this spell is cast twice, it is possible to match samples of blood originating from the same creature by comparing the prints.</p>

			<p>When you cast this spell, all footprints and fingerprints within a 45-foot radius of a point you touch become highlighted and glow faintly for the duration. At the time of casting, choose any period of time up to the last 10 days to the present; only footprints and fingerprints left within that time will be highlighted. Each creature whose footprints or fingerprints are detected by the spell is assigned a unique color, but are not otherwise identified. Any creature that moves or touches objects in the area will also leave colorful footprints and fingerprints, which might reveal invisible creatures in the area.</p>

			<p>You bind one creature or object to a location, cursing it so that it may never leave. Choose a target and a location within range, both of which you must be able to see. If the target is a creature, it must make a Charisma saving throw (a willing creature may choose to fail this save), or be cursed to be permanently bound to the chosen location. While cursed, the target can act and move around freely, as long as it remains within 20 feet of the point it is bound to. If the target begins its turn outside of this area, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be dragged 60 feet towards the point it was bound to.</p>

If you cast this spell within a burial place such as a graveyard, mausoleum, or barrow, 1d4 piles of bones are exhumed instead of 1.

The estate consists of a manor containing a vault, a spacious 200-by-200-foot courtyard, and a 10-foot high wrought iron fence around the perimeter. Any creature within the estate’s area is escorted away by harmless but forceful specters.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can create any floor plan you like for the manor, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side, or five stories in total, including basements. The manor is adorned with barred windows and decorative gargoyles, but is furnished and decorated as you choose. Once the manor is first created, these details are recorded in the miniature manor used to cast the spell and can’t be changed. The manor is staffed by 50 skeletons obedient to you and contains enough food to serve 50 people each day for a week. The skeletons can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">The manor contains a 15-foot cube vault, which is an extradimensional space. Items placed within the vault will be present next time you cast this spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">The courtyard is drenched in necromantic magic, such that any humanoid buried in its grounds rises 24 hours later as a ghoul under your control, as per the spell <em>animate dead</em>. When the spell is cast, 3 ghouls are animated in the courtyard. These undead are under your control, but can’t leave the estate. They patrol the estate if given no other instructions. Undead can’t be turned within the estate.</p>
			<p class="indent">The estate crumbles into dust and bone after 7 days, and all items placed within the manor appear safely in the space the manor occupied. If cast in the same place once every 7 days for a year, the estate becomes permanent.</p>

The spell reveals if a creature attempts to bet property they do not own. A bet is finalized when you and the target agree on the bet, solidifying the bet with a handshake or similar gesture. Property or currency bet on the game is teleported to the winner at the game’s conclusion. The loser is also magically compelled to take any action (such as bestowing a title) promised as part of a bet.</p>

			<p>When you cast this spell, you stab a black, ritualistically-prepared human heart. The ichor from the heart infects the land with foul necromantic energies, causing up to one hundred piles of bones or corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within a 1-mile radius to rise from the dead, becoming skeletons or zombies (the GM has the creatures’ game statistics). The undead dig their way out of graves, smash their way out of mausoleums, and tear down cemetery gates.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature that is holding the heart can use its action to issue a general command to all undead created by the spell, such as to destroy a town or hunt down a particular creature. Only one general command can be issued to the undead every 24 hours. If not issued a command, the undead indiscriminately attack living creatures, other than the creature that is holding the heart and creatures designated by it. Once given an order, the undead continue to follow it to the best of their ability until the task is complete.</p>
			<p class="indent">Even while you hold the heart, the undead are not directly under your control, and therefore don't count against any limitations of undead you can command.</p>
			<p class="indent">The undead remain animated until the spell ends. The spell ends if the heart is destroyed (AC 20, HP 10, immunity to necrotic, poison, psychic damage) or targeted by a <em>dispel magic</em> spell cast as a 9th level spell. When the spell ends, all undead animated by it are instantly destroyed, crumpling into a heap. The spell also ends if every undead created by it is destroyed.</p>

			<p>This spell intensifies gravity in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in this area must spend two feet of movement for every foot moved, including flying, jumping, and climbing movement. This can be combined with difficult terrain to slow movement to a quarter of normal speed. If a prone creature wishes to stand up, it must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a failure, it can’t move at all on its turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"> Objects in the area, including those being worn or carried, weigh double their usual weight, which may cause creatures to become encumbered or cause load-bearing spells like <em>levitate</em> to fail. Any ranged weapon attacks that pass into, out of, or through the area have disadvantage, and any falling damage dealt within the spell’s area is doubled.</p>

			<p class="indent">This spell’s duration varies depending upon when and where it was cast. If cast in a location where time passes normally, the spell lasts until the twelfth stroke of the next midnight, however long that may be. Elsewhere, the spell lasts for 24 hours. When the spell ends, the carriage’s occupants are ejected into adjacent unoccupied spaces, the carriage shrinks back into a vegetable, and the quasi-real horses fade.</p>
			<p class="indent">The carriage and horses count as a single object with 12 AC and 100 HP. The spell ends early if the carriage and horses are reduced to 0 HP.</p>

At that point, the missile moves suddenly, as if it was just fired or thrown with a range of 120 feet. If a creature is in the line of fire, the missile makes an attack which adds your spell attack bonus to the attack roll, and does the basic damage of whatever missile type was used (missiles that vary by launcher use the highest possible damage dice).</p>

			<p>As spectral instruments appear playing around you, you begin singing a well-known song and others feel compelled to join in. For the duration, when a creature comes within 30 feet of you or begins a turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or begin singing along with you. A singing creature matches the pitch and words of the song as closely as it can, even if it can’t speak the song’s language. Furthermore, it can’t speak normally (though it can still communicate telepathically) and it can’t perform the verbal components of spells. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.</p>

			<p>This spell creates an invisible, shapeless force that performs intellectual tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, an Intelligence of 12, and it can’t attack.

The accountant can perform intellectual tasks that a human clerk could do, such as assaying prices, updating accounts, managing inventories, or computing interest. Once you give the command, the accountant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. The accountant can perform no physical labor and is not able to lift any object heavier than a bottle of ink.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you command the accountant to perform a task that would move it more than 300 feet away from you, the spell ends.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you cast this spell, three tentacles made of water appear around your body for the duration. As part of the action used to cast the spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can command one of these tentacles to grapple a Large or smaller creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the tentacle. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, freeing itself on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can grapple as many creatures as you have tentacles. You can use an action or bonus action on your turn to release a grappled creature, or to drag it up to 20 feet in a direction you choose.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can also use the tentacles to manipulate objects as an action or a bonus action. Each tentacle can lift up to 100 pounds, and you can command multiple tentacles to work together to lift the same object as part of the same action or bonus action. The tentacles are not capable of detailed control—for example, they cannot open a chest or uncork a bottle. Burning objects are extinguished when a tentacle grabs them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>At Higher Levels</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you gain an additional tentacle for every slot level above 4th.</p>
