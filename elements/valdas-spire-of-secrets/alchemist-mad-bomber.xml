            <p>While many “mad bombers” aren't actually mad, it takes a special kind of crazy to devote one's life to studying explosives. Most alchemists who specialize in this field are incorrigible pyromaniacs who take great pleasure in burning, blasting, and blowing things up. Mad bombers are always working to improve their bombs' effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, when you prime and throw a bomb, you can set a duration for its detonation, which can be any number of rounds (any increment of 6 seconds) up to 1 minute.
