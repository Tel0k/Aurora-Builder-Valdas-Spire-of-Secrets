			<p>Martyrs of Discord are chosen at random to sow chaos and stoke evil wherever they travel. They light things on fire, commit petty crimes, and even murder when the fancy strikes. Given to their own predilections, martyrs of discord are unified only by their charge to disrupt the status quo as much as possible.</p>
			<p class="indent">No one is certain why the gods make martyrs of Discord in the first place. Perhaps it is at the whim of one capricious or evil god, or perhaps the gods desire a balance between chaos and law, and must sometimes stoke the fire to restore this balance.</p>

Once you use the coin, the coin goes to the GM, who can use it to enhance any roll made by an NPC or monster. Once the GM uses the coin, it passes back to you, and so on. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain the coin, whether or not the GM has used it.</p>
