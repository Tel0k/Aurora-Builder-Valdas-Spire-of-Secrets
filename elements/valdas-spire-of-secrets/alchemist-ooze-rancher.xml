            <p>Unsurprisingly, oozes, jellies, and slimes are a fascinating subject for alchemists who wish to figure out how inanimate chemicals can form together and rise up in a moving, hungry mass. The answer to this question may very well be at the heart of alchemy itself. Alchemists who choose to research slimes in depth are called ooze ranchers, for they breed and keep numerous slimes to experiment upon.</p>

            <p>Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you've developed a pheromone mix that endears all kinds of slime to you. Whenever an Ooze tries to attack you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your bomb save DC. On a failed save, its attack misses. On a successful save, the Ooze is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 2nd level, you can mix your bomb's explosive contents with the remnants of an Ooze, changing it into a slime bomb. A slime bomb deals no damage, but coats each creature within the blast radius in a viscous, green slime. A creature coated in slime can't take the Dash or Disengage actions. Slime can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water or by taking an action to remove most of it.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, you've learned a clever alchemical trick for condensing Oozes into denser states and storing them in stasis for later use. Whenever you brew potions, you can spend 2 reagent dice to create an ooze bottle (see Magic Items).</p>
            <p class="indent">Your Oozes use your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus for their attack rolls, and use your bomb save DC in place of their save DCs.</p>

            <p>By 10th level, you have injected yourself with ozoplasm, the gooey substance which composes Oozes and slimes, mutating your form. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing (though your equipment doesn't similarly compress). Additionally, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at 18th level, you've solved the problem that prevented large Oozes from being bottled: you just needed a much larger bottle. You have an <i>ooze jug</i>, which functions like an <i>ooze bottle</i>, but contains a single larger Ooze. You can only have one <i>ooze jug</i> at a time. You can fill it with the following Oozes when you brew potions:</p>
