			<p>From the earliest days of life, storms (and particularly lightning) have struck the creatures caught in them with awe and terror. The Thunderlords, by contrast, draw wild inspiration from the majesty of nature, and seek to, quite literally, capture lightning in a bottle.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting when you join this guild at 3rd level, you construct a lightning-generating power cell, which comes connected to a set of conduit gauntlets. When you gain these items, you are assumed to have been working on them in your spare time, only bringing them to full functionality when you choose this subclass. If these pieces of equipment are lost or damaged, you can replace them over the course of a long rest with 100 gp worth of materials.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Charge Points.</b> Your power cell gives you a number of charge points, which represent the electrical energy stored within your power cell. Your maximum number of charge points is equal to half your craftsman level, rounded up. You can spend these points to generate various electrical effects through your power cell. You regain all expended charge points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Using Charge Points.</b> Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack that deals lightning damage, you can spend 1 or more charge points, up to a maximum number equal to your proficiency bonus, to enhance the power of the attack. When you do so, choose one of the following effects:</p>
            <h6>ARC</h6>
            <p>Lightning arcs to nearby targets. Choose a number of creatures equal to the number of charge points you spend that are within 15 feet of the target of your attack. Each of the chosen creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes lightning damage equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
            <h6>DISCHARGE</h6>
			<p>The creature you hit takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage for each charge point you spend.</p>
            <h6>JOLT</h6>
			<p>The creature you hit can't take reactions until the start of your next turn.</p>
