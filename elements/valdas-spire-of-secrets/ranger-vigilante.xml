            <p>When evildoers run rampant and the city calls out for justice, vigilantes rise to the occasion. Clad in a larger-than-life persona, capped off with a cape, mask, pair of tights, or some combination thereof, vigilantes embark on a crusade against villainy in all its forms. Many vigilantes are beacons of hope, dispatching bows with fighting prowess and dramatic flair, while other paint themselves as brooding antiheroes, out for themselves and seeking some kind of vengeance against the criminal underworld.</p>
