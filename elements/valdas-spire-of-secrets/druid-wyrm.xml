        <description>
            <p>Druids who join the Circle of the Wyrm hold dragons in higher esteem than all other works of creation. These druids believe, as many dragons do, that wyrms are perfect creatures: the pinnacle of all life brought into existence by the antediluvian gods. Likewise, these druids aspire to perfect wyrmhood, and gradually become like dragonkind.</p>

            <p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, instead of as an action. Furthermore, your beast shapes resemble dragon hybrids, replete with scales and fangs, and gain the following traits while you are transformed:</p>
            <p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Breath Weapon.</em></strong> You can use your action and expend one spell slot to exhale draconic energy from your mouth. Choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 damage of the chosen type, plus 1d10 for each spell level higher than 1st. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.</p>
