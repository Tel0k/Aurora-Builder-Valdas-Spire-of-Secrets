        <description>
            <p>Kings and leaders are bound by an unspoken covenant to the gods to govern their people justly and peacefully. When a monarch turns their back on the gods, embraces tyranny, or uses cruel measures against their own people, a martyr is called to end their reign. Rarely does a Martyr of Revolution come with peaceful measures, for when a king must fall, only the sword can provide the necessary leverage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Such martyrs are not only called to battle kings; any person of influence that oppresses others and abuses their power might wrong the gods enough to earn the ire of a martyr. In dark times, a martyr might be tasked with clearing a continent of despots and oppressors, calling for a full-scale military campaign of liberation.</p>
