			<p>Vampires, demons, lycanthropes, and Aberrations all have one thing in common: they are all magical threats, best combated through magical means. To meet these foes on a level playing field, occultists indulge in arcana, filling their grimoires with magical secrets and mastering a handful of spells. Occultists are the most likely investigators to cavort with warlocks, borrow tricks from wizards and magicians, and dabble in dark magic to defeat their foes.</p>
